<!-- A one sentence description of the project or assignment -->
Setup and Net Art assignment is about how to open a Visual studio file, downloaded to your Github, open a ssh key, and commit and push the code updates through the Terminal. 

<!-- It is good practice to add an about or summary -->
## About

In this assignment I created a website using html/css to illustrate part of a Deerhoof song, "Flower". 
The first part of the assignment was to use the code editor Visual Studio and upload different versions to the Github.In this repository you can see different versions of the html and css files and follow the progress of this exercise.

<!-- It is essential to describe how to set up your project -->
## Setup
To run my code you need to:
1. Download the repository to your computer from my Github account. 
2. Open terminal. 
3. Navigate to project folder.
4. Create a Local Web server.

5. Open localhost

Now you are going to see the website in your local server.

<!-- Any knowledge or tools you will need before hand -->
### Prerequisites

To be able to open and this website in your computer you need:
1. to have a trminal or Command line.

# Notes & Process

In this assignment I created a website using html/css to illustrate part of a Deerhoof song, Flower. 
The first part of the assignment was to use the code editor Visual Studio and upload different version to the Github.
For this first part of the assignment i have a lot of difficulties understanding the terminal flow such as: how to create a file through the terminal and opened in Visual studio. Because at first i tried to make the step using my notes from the class, I missed information and I wasn't able to open the file. Then, I followed [“Your First Website Guide”] (https://github.com/itp-dwd/2020-spring/blob/master/guides/your-first-website-guide.md) from the class on github and that helped me to complete the information. After i open the file on visual Studio I copy paste the template from the first website example:

After I was able to see the run on github I used the instructions to open a local server. 



<!-- How you built this project - Include images, gifs, and notes here -->
## Process & Documentation

Running website in local server:
At the beginning of the project i use the Step 4 instructions to run a local server, writing: $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer

However, after I while I notice that for some reason the local server didn't show all the changes that I was making. I decide to use another instructions that I have to create a local server: for this one I used the command: browser-sync start --server -f -w

Not sure why but In this case, the ip address is 3000 and the local server uploaded each time that I save the code.
